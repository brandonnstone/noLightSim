# A website for you.
Extension of a "project" made during HackCU 2017.
Live at http://nluniversesim.com/home.html until it isn't.

## About
The original use of this website has lived its course. Now the website is yours. Any and all data submitted to the site's email address will be placed in a queue to be posted on the website. Due to the site still being in my name all content will have to be reviewed (see Rules) prior to posting.\
Submit files (audio, video, whatever) to submit@nluniversesim.com. Text does not have to be saved in any format and can be directly sent to the email address.

## Rules for posting
Rules are inherently lax but of course some content will not be posted. This is just to ensure the site dies of old age (ex: expiring domain) and isn't killed prematurely (ex: getting taken down for hate speech). Please use common sense as to what you should and should not submit. If you feel any content is innappropriate please provide a description and/or screenshot of the offending post to report@nluniversesim.com and it will be reviewed ASAP.

## Notes:
If anyone would like to volunteer to admin for this shoot an email to the submit link above or contact me directly.

## FAQ
#### *Why would I post to this website instead of my Facebook, twitter, any other site ever?*\
Other sites censor heavily. This is as lax as can be without being illegal. You can post anonymously or attach a name if you would like recognition.\
#### *Why is the site so basic?*\
It works.
#### *Can we post ANYTHING?*\
No. But you can post things that you might not want to post to your public profiles but still have your content accessible for an extended period of time unlike other anonymous post boards.
